# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Short summary: We consider the problem of online convex optimization with switching cost, in the limited information setting, where an algorithm can take action $x_{t}$ using only information about the gradient of $f_{t - 1}$ at multiple points. We show a surprising fact: a simple projected gradient descent based algorithm is powerful enough and has similar theoretical guarantees as more sophisticated algorithms (which require even more information). We derive (almost matching) lower bounds for the problem and show a fundamental difference when the switching cost is quadratic vs linear."
