Hi all, I am a Sophomore Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur mostly interested in theoritical Probabilistic Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

My research work in sophomore year has been focussed on application of Variational Bayesian Inference to tensor based models. Currently I am working on extending the idea of Traffic prediction using Matrix factorisation to Tensor decompositon. 

In summer 19 I explored Probabilistic Machine Learning. My experience with Deep Learning and to some extent Reinforcement Learning in Freshmen year helped me somewhat. I studied different topics such as Conjugacy, Latent Variable Models, Expectation Maximization Algorithm, Approximate Inference(i.e. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Stimulation and Variational Bayesian Inference), Gibbs Sampling etc. I mostly worked on Variational Inference by exploring advances in the field such as Stochastic VI, Black Box VI etc. Further I explored Stochastic Variational Inference by going through research papers on the same.

I am interested in exploring Theoritical ML more rigorously mostly because I am quite fascinated by the multitude of Maths governing Probabilistic Machine Learning. Although I don't have much exposure to the same but I am quite hopeful to see myself working on the same in a couple of years from now.
